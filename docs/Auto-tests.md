# TL/DR
1. Run `scripts/integresql/run-compose.bat` (it will start a docker instance of [IntegreSQL](https://github.com/allaboutapps/integresql) and Postgres that will be dedicated to tests).


# Auto tests
Every backend functionality should be tested automatically.
**As a rule of thumb, we expect every HTTP method to have at least one integration test**. This way we make sure that functionality generally works and is not completely broken :)
Writing a suite of UnitTests is also encouraged.

# Backend
## Overview
We have 2 kinds of auto-tests:
1. Unit-tests (`MccSoft.TemplateApp.App.Tests`). Here we test classes in 'isolation' from ASP.Net framework (i.e. http requests, model binding, deserialization, etc is not involved).
These tests are fast and are best for fine-grained testing (testing every detail of a certain method/functionality).
1. Component-tests (`MccSoft.TemplateApp.ComponentTests`) also known as [Integration tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-6.0). These tests set up a real web-server (running in-memory) and we send real http requests to this server in tests.
These tests test the whole request pipeline and you could express a full business scenarios with these kind of tests.
They are a bit slower (compared to Unit tests), but give the maximum confidence that the system works.
These tests usually are not changed during refactoring (i.e. if you split/move functionality between services, leaving API untouched).

   To send requests we use autogenerated client (based on Swagger definitions). See [the article on how to generate them](./Client-autogeneration.md)


#Frontend
Nothing special to write yet

# End-to-end
We also have end-to-end tests (`uitests` folder).
These test run a real browser pointing to a dev stage and perform operation via it.
Details are available as a [separate article](./UI-tests.md).


# Backend code coverage
We strive to have 100% coverage on Controllers.
(running tests with coverage significantly increase execution time: from 5mins to 20mins, so we no longer run coverage for every test run. probably we need a separate pipeline to run the coverage)
To verify that you could download `coverage.cobertura.xml` files from build Artifacts (`backend_coverage` folder) and put it to `tools/coverage/cobertura` folder. Then run `run.bat` and check `report` folder to see the coverage. You could apply filters to see the coverage on separate files/classes.
You will get reports like this:
