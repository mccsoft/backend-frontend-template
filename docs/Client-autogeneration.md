# Autogenerated http clients
We don't manually write Typescript http-clients, instead we autogenerate them (not only Typescript, but C# http-clients as well).
You should manually regenerate the clients when you add/update controllers/actions public interface.

## How to regenerate clients
### Frontend
If you are changing backend API and would like to update the client:
1. Run your backend (usually via F5 in your IDE)
2. From root folder run `yarn generate-api-client`.
### Frontend - remote
If you do not run backend locally, but your typescript client seems outdated, you could regenerate the client using remote backend
1. From root folder run `yarn generate-api-client-remote` (make sure you have specified correct remote URL in [package.json](../frontend/package.json), "generate-api-client-remote" script).
### Backend
1. Run `GenerateHttpClient_ValidAndExported` auto test (from [BasicApiTests.cs](../webapi/tests/MccSoft.TemplateApp.ComponentTests/BasicApiTests.cs))

## Tweaking to default client generation
Right now we post-process generated Typescript client, in order to provide correct types.
We do the following modifications:
1. In ResponseDtos we change:
`titleId!: number | undefined;` -> `titleId!: number | null;`
 We do this because in reality server sends us `null`, not `undefined`.

2. In Request (HTTP PATCH) DTO we change how `DateTime` is handled:
  `data["start"] = this.start ? this.start.toISOString() : <any>undefined;` ->
`data["start"] = this.start ? this.start.toISOString() : this.start;`
  We do this because it's otherwise impossible to pass both `null` and `undefined` to server. Here's the NSwag issue: https://github.com/RicoSuter/NJsonSchema/issues/1239
